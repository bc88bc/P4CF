#2: To batch calculate for multiple earthquakes, one can type the command-line inputs 
into a single text file, then run *P4CF* with the standard input re-directed to that file (for example, *P4CF < 0169.in*).

#3: When finite-fault model of an earthquake is unavailable, the companion 
FORTRAN code *CCLD* (written by Bob Youngs) has been used by the NGA Projects to produce a fault plane.
The procedure involves the simulation of 101 plausible rupture planes according 
to the known information of earthquake magnitude, hypocenter location, and focal mechanism (strike and dip), 
as well as the proper magnitude-source scaling relationship.
Distance measure $R_{RUP}$ is then computed using each of the simulated planes for a regular grid of (hypothetical) sites.
The selected fault plane is the one that best matches the median of 101 simulated $R_{RUP}$.
