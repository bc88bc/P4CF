abstract = { The NGA-West2 project database expands on its predecessor to include worldwide ground motion data recorded from shallow crustal earthquakes in active tectonic regimes post-2000 and a set of small-to-moderate-magnitude earthquakes in California between 1998 and 2011. The database includes 21,336 (mostly) three-component records from 599 events. The parameter space covered by the database is M 3.0 to M 7.9, closest distance of 0.05 to 1,533 km, and site time-averaged shear-wave velocity in the top 30 m of VS30 = 94 m/s to 2,100 m/s (although data becomes sparse for distances >400 km and VS30 > 1,200 m/s or <150 m/s). The database includes uniformly processed time series and response spectral ordinates for 111 periods ranging from 0.01 s to 20 s at 11 damping ratios. Ground motions and metadata for source, path, and site conditions were subject to quality checks by ground motion prediction equation developers and topical working groups. }

abstract = { A key component of the NGA research project was the development of a strong-motion database with improved quality and content that could be used for ground-motion research as well as for engineering practice. Development of the NGA database was executed through the Lifelines program of the PEER Center with contributions from several research organizations and many individuals in the engineering and seismological communities. Currently, the data set consists of 3551 publicly available multi-component records from 173 shallow crustal earthquakes, ranging in magnitude from 4.2 to 7.9. Each acceleration time series has been corrected and filtered, and pseudo absolute spectral acceleration at multiple damping levels has been computed for each of the 3 components of the acceleration time series. The lowest limit of usable spectral frequency was determined based on the type of filter and the filter corner frequency. For NGA model development, the two horizontal acceleration components were further rotated to form the orientation-independent measure of horizontal ground motion (GMRotI50). In addition to the ground-motion parameters, a large and comprehensive list of metadata characterizing the recording conditions of each record was also developed. NGA data have been systematically checked and reviewed by experts and NGA developers. }
