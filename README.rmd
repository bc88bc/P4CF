FORTRAN code *P4CF* computes earthquake source and path **P**arameters for(**4**) a **C**urved **F**ault rupture. 

This code has been used in PEER's NGA-West Projects (Chiou and others, 2008; 
Ancheta and others, 2014) and NGA-Subduction Project (Contreras and others, 2021) to 
provide some of the source and path metadata included in the respective project database.
The path parameters include commonly used distance measures and the direct-point directivity parameters (Chiou and Spudich, 2013). 
The source parameters include the rupture trace length, ruptured area, strike direction (in terms of both global average and local variation),
and the location of the closest point on fault.


# Compiling P4CF.for

P4CF.for is (mostly) a standard FORTRAN77 code. It has been successfully compiled using the following compilers under 
several operating systems:

1. Layhey Fortran (release 5.60a, in Windows 10): lf95 p4cf.for -dbl

2. GNU Fortran (gcc version 4.7.1, in Windows 10): gfortran p4cf.for -freal-4-real-8 -o p4cf.exe

3. GNU Fortran (??, for Linux, Ubuntu subsystem of Windows 10)

4. GNU Fortran (??, for MacOS)

Windows is the primary OS under which P4CF has been developed, tested, and applied.
As such, discussions below are based on the Windows 10 version of compiled code. 


# Running P4CF

## Command-Line Inputs

_P4CF_  should be executed in a DOS command prompt with the following inputs: 

- Line 1: *EQID_fault_ID* (character, 'a5'). 
  - It is a concatenation of *EQID* (first 4 characters) and *fault_ID* (fifth character).
    - *fault_ID* is included to track the calculations for each individual (disjointed) rupture trace used 
      to approximate the co-seismic rupture of an earthquake

- Line 2: *inLatLong* (logical)

  - if FALSE, Cartesian coordinates (*X, Y*) are used to specify horizontal locations
  - if TRUE,  (Longitude, Latitude) are used to specify locations

- Line 3: *method* (integer) 
  - To project rupture trace down-dip to form the depth portion of rupture surface, two methods have been implemented:  
    - *method = 1*: .... 
    - *method = 2*: projection is perpendicular to the average strike direction specified next

- Line 4 (only if *method* = 2): *AveStrike* (real) 
  - The average strike direction (in units of degree) perpendicular to which down-dip projection is performed
  - If *AveStrike* = -999, it is determined within *P4CF* by connecting the first vertex to the last vertex of input rupture trace

- Line 5 (only if *method* = 2): *AveDip* (real) 
  - The dip angle to be used for down-dip projection of rupture trace, in units of degree

- To continue, repeat Line 1 through Line 5 for next earthquake. 
- To terminate, enter 'q' on Line 1.

### Notes

#1: In *P4CF*, calculations are performed in (*X, Y, Z*) coordinate system. 

- When input locations are in longitude/latitude, they will be transformed to (X, Y) coordinate
    by first using the *haverside* formula to compute the (great circle) distance between the 
    user-specified origin and the point of interest, then decomposing the distance into the east (X) and the north (Y) components.
  - A transformation of (X, Y) back to longitude/latitude is performed when longitude/latitude outputs are required.
      
- *Z* is the elevation (in KM) of the point of interest
  - When a point is below sea level, its *Z* is negative and its *H* (depth) is positive
    
#2: For batch calculation of multiple earthquakes, command-line inputs 
may be typed into a single text file, then *P4CF* can be ran with the standard input re-directed to that file (for example, *P4CF < 0169.in*)

#3: In the NGA projects, when finite-fault model of an earthquake is unavailable, the companion 
FORTRAN code *CCLD* has been used to produce a fault plane 
by simulating 101 plausible rupture planes according 
to the known information of hypocenter location and focal mechanism (strike and dip). 
The selected fault plane is the one that best matches the median $R_{RUP}$ of 101 simulations. 


## File Inputs

In addition to the command-line inputs, two input files (per earthquake) are required. 

1. Finite-fault file, whose name must be the concatenation of *EQID_fault_id* 
   and '.TLL' (*inLatLon* is *TRUE*) or '.TXY' (*inLatLon* is *FALSE*)
   
2. Station file, whose name must be the concatenation of *EQID* (without *fault_id*)
   and '.SLL' (*inLatLon* is *TRUE*) or '.SXY' (*inLatLon* is *FALSE*)
 - Because the same set of stations are used for all faults, *fault_id* does not need to be part of station-file name

NOTE: *P4CF* assumes that these two files are located in the directory where *P4CF* run is conducted.


### Input file of finite-fault model 

- Line 1: Header

- Line 2: Origin of the (X, Y) coordinate (real)

  - if *inLatLon* is *FALSE*, (0, 0)
  
  - if *inLatLon* is *TRUE*, (latitude, longitude) of the origin


- Line 3: Hypocenter location (*Hyp_x, Hyp_y, Hyp_z*)

  - If *inLatLon* is *FALSE*, hypocenter is given in Cartesian coordinate (*X, Y, Z*)
  - If *inLatLon* is *TRUE*,  hypocenter is given as (Latitude, Longitude, *Z*)
    - Elevation *Z* is the negative of hypoentral depth

  - Hypocenter can be specified in terms of along-strike and down-dip 
    locations relative to the first vertex of rupture trace. 
    To use this option, set *Hyp_x* to -9999; *Hyp_y* and *Hyp_z* are then interpreted as the 
    along-strike and down-dip locations, in fractions of rupture length and rupture width, respectively.
  
- Line 4: Number of (connected) rupture segments (*nseg*) 

- Lines 5 to (5 + *nseg*): Coordinates of the (*nseg* + 1) vertices of rupture trace. 

  - If *inLatLon* is FALSE, vertices are given in (X, Y) coordinate
  - if *inLatLon* is TRUE, vertices are given in Latitude and Longitude
  
- Line *5 + nseg + 1*: (*Dip*(i), i = 1, *nseg*), *H_Trace*, *H_Top*, *H_Bot*
  - (*Dip*(i), i = 1, *nseg*): dip angle (in degree) of each trace segment
  - *H_Trace*: depth (in KM) to fault trace
    - *H_Trace* is deprecated; it is kept for backward compatibility
  - *H_Top*: depth (in KM) to the top of rupture ($Z_{TOR}$ in GMPE parlance)
  - *H_Bot*: depth (in KM) to the bottom of rupture

- Line *5+nseg+2*: *Rake*(i), i = 1, *nseg*
  - Rake angle (in degree) of each rupture segment


#### Notes

1. Strike of rupture trace dictates the order in which its vertices are specified on in Lines 5 to (5+ *nseg*) of the finite-fault input. 
   The strike of segment $i$ is the direction from vertex *i* to vertex *i+1*.

2. When using *method* 1, depth to top of fault must be equal to depth to top of rupture trace (Line *5+nseg+1* of finite-fault input). 
   

### List of stations and their coordinates

One input file per earthquake and, after file header, one line per recording station

- *EQID, Sta_seq_no, Sta_name, Sta_long, Sta_lat, Sta_elev* (not used)
  - The first four fields consists of the earthquake identification, the fifth field represents the fault identifier
  - For the .SLL file (coordindates are in longitude/latitude), Sta_long and Sta_lat are the longitude and latitude of station
  - For the .SXY file (coordinates are not in longitude/latitude), Sta_long and Sta_lat are the easting and northing coordinate of station. 


# *P4CF* Outputs

## Source and Path Parameters 

Outputs for individual EQ are in file *EQID_fault_id.out*. 
As a convenience, outputs of all earthquakes in the same batch run are aggregated in *P4CF.out*.

For each station-earthquake pair, following columns are included in the output files.

- *EQID* 

- *SSN* and *StaName*

- Station coordinates.
  - (*StaX, StaY*): Cartesian coordinates (*X, Y*) relative to the origin specified in the finite-fault file. If *inLatLon* is *FALSE*, they are
      verbatim of the input coordinates.
    
  - (*U, T*): GC2 coordinates (Spudich and Chiou, 2015) with respect to the rupture trace specified in the finite-fault file 
      - Negative *T* coordinate indicates that station is located on the footwall side, 
      while positive *T* coordinate indicates station is on the hanging-wall side

- Distance measures

  - Point-source distances
    - $R_{epi}$: distance between Station and Epicenter
    - $R_{hyp}$: distance between Station and Hypocenter

  - Distances to finite-fault

    - $R_{rup}$: shortest distance to the finite-fault model
    - $R_{jb}$: shortest distance to the surface projection of finite-fault model (aka Joyner-Boore distance)
    - $R_{rms}$: root-mean-squared distance to the finite-fault model $\Big(\frac{\int_{\Sigma} R(\zeta, x)^{-2} \ d\Sigma}{A}\Big)^{1/2}$, 
    where $\zeta$ is the location vector of any point inside the ruptured surface ($\Sigma$), 
    and $R(\zeta, x)$ is the distance betweehn $\zeta$ and the station location vector $x$ (see, for example, Chiou and others, 2000).

  - Distances derived from (*U, T*)
    - $R_x = |T|$, strike-normal distance
    - $R_y = U - 2/L$, where *L* is the rupture length, strike-parallel distance
    - $R_{y0}$
    
     $$R_{y0} = 
        \begin{cases}
           -U    & U < 0 \\
           0     & 0  \le U \le L \\
           U - L & U > 0
        \end{cases}
      $$

- Strike-parallel direction 

  - *AveStrike*: 
    - If *method* = 1, the average strike-parallel direction, computed as the azimuth from the first vertex to the last vertex  
    - If *method* = 2, verbatim of the input strike direction, if it is not -999. If input value is -999, *AveStrike* is calculated 
      the same as in *method* = 1.
  
  - *LocStrike*: Average strike-parallel direction local to the recording station
    - It is computed as the length-weighted average of strike direction 
      over a stretch of 20-km rupture starting at the closest point and moving toward the hypocenter 

  - Though either strike-parallel direction can be utilized to rotate the two horizontal components of acceleration time series 
to the strike-normal and the strike-parallel components, $LocStrike$ is the one that has been used for the two NGA-West Projects.


- Rupture directivity parameters (Chiou and Spudich, 2013)

  - *ChPrime* ($\hat{c}'$): the approximate isochrone velocity, normalized to a shear-wave velocity of 3.2 km/s
  - *E*: length of the line source initiating at the hypocenter and ending at the direct point 
  - *aveR*: avearge radiation pattern over the hypocenter-to-direct-point line source
  - *DPP*: direct-point parameter of rupture directivity ($= ...$)


- Location of closest point on fault (*PcLat, PcLon, PcZ*)
  

## Constructed Finite-Fault Model

A detailed description of the constructed fault rupture is included in file *EQID_fault_id.ref*. Another file (*EQID_fault_id.PLL*), 
includes just the 3D polygon, used mainly for plotting map of rupture plane.


# Limitations of *P4CF*

P4CF is developed mainly for the situation of variable strike direction (curved rupture trace), 
which is a common geometry complexity of published finite fault models.
It is hence limited for modeling other aspects of geometry complexity. 

1. P4CF applies only to connected rupture trace (that is, no gaps in modeled rupture trace)

  - The first step in dealing with disconnected rupture planes is to try simplifying the observed rupture
    by connecting into a single, connected trace. 
  - Connection is not always feasible for very complex rupture. For example, in the case of the 1995 **M**6.9 Kobe earthquake,
    the two ruptured faults (Suma/Suwayama Fault and Nojima Fault) dip in opposite direction, making it impossible to connect them in a reason fashion. 
    Another example is the 2002 **M**7.9 Denali earthquake (EQID 0169 of the NGA-W2 database). 
    The three ruptured faults cannot be satisfactorily connected because their traces overlap considerably in horizontal extent.
    In addition, Susitna Glacial Fault is a dipping reverse fault, while
    the other two (Denali Fault and Totschunda Fault) are near vertical strike-slip faults.
    For complex rupture, each individual fault can be modeled separately and their P4CF results consolidated afterward.  

2. When using projection method 1, joint variation of strike and dip is allowed, though not encouraged.
   P4CF does not check nor guarantee against pathological rupture plane. So, when using multiple dip angles, 
   checking the geological adequacy of constructed fault plane (.ref output file) is strongly recommend, particularly when there are 
   short segments or large change in strike direction. 
   
  - When using projection method 2, this is not an issue because only a single dip 
    angle is required (for the purpose of projecting rupture trace down-dip).

3. Depth to the rupture trace must be a constant. This restriction is enforced by allowing only a single $H_{top}$ input.

4. Rake angle is uniform. 

  - In P4CF rake is used in computing average radiation pattern. Variable rake is allowed and relaxing this restriction is feasible, 
    it has not yet been implemented in P4CF. (... Is a single rake used in radiation pattern calculation?)
