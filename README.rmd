FORTRAN code *P4CF* computes source and path **P**arameters for(**4**) a **C**urved **F**ault rupture. This code has been used in PEER's NGA-West Projects (Chiou and others, 2008; Ancheta et al., 2014) and NGA-Subduction Project (Contreras et al. 2021) to calculate source and path metadata for the respective project database.

# Inputs

Inputs to _P4CF_ are entered via a DOS command, as follows: 
1. 

To terminate calculation, enter *q* for *EQID*.

NOTE: When finite-fault model of an earthquake is unavailable, the companion 
FORTRAN code *CCLD* can be used to simulate possible fault rupture planes according 
to the known information of hypocenter location and focal mechanism (strike/dip). 

1. Inputs on command-line, which apply to all earthquakes
2. Finite-fault model file, whose name has the extension .*TLL* or .*TXY*
3. Station coordinates file, whose name has the extension .*SLL* or .*SXY*


## Command-line inputs


## Finite-fault model input file (.*TLL* or .*TXY*)
- Line 1: 
- Line 2: Hypocenter location in latitude, longitude, and depth
  - Hypocenter location may be specified as a fraction of fault length and a fraction of fault width along-strike and down-dip position, respectively.  Relative to the upper-left corner of rupture plane (that is, the first vertex of rupture trace in the finite-fault file), 
- Line 3:
- Line 4:
- Line 5:
- Line 6: 


### Important Conventions

## Station coordinates input file (.TLL or .TXY)

One line per station

- (a5, ....) EQID, Sta_seq_no, Sta_name, Sta_long, Sta_lat, Sta_elev (not used)
  - The first four fields consists of the earthquake identification, the fifth field represents the fault identifier
  - For the .SLL file (coordindates are in longitude/latitude), Sta_long and Sta_lat are the longitude and latitude of station
  - For the .SXY file (coordinates are not in longitude/latitude), Sta_long and Sta_lat are the easting and northing coordinate of station. 


# Outputs

Outputs of *P4CF* include

- Station coordinates
    - $(X, Y)$: If input is int geographic coordinates (longitude/latitude), Cartesian coordinates relative to the origin specified in the finite-fault file
    - $(U, T)$: Generalized coordinates 2 (GC2) relative to the rupture trace specified in the finite-fault file (Spudich and Chiou, 2015)
      - $R_y$ and $R_{y0}$ in the NGA database are derived from the $U$ coordinate as follows: 
        - $R_y = U - 2/L$, where $L$ is the rupture length 
        - $R_{y0}$ = ....
      - $R_x = |T|$ 
        - Negative $T$ indicates that station is located on the foot-wall side, while positive $T$ indicates hangingwall side

- Distance measures

  - Station-to-point-source distance
    - $R_{epi}$: distance between Station and Epicenter
    - $R_{hyp}$: distance between Station and Hypocenter

  - Station-to-finite-rupture distance (distances to the Finite-Fault (*FF*) rupture model of earthquake rupture)

    - $R_{rup}$: shortest distance to the FF model
    - $R_{jb}$: shortest distance to the surface projection of *FF* model
    - $R_{rms}$: root-mean-squared distance to *FF* model $definition$

- Finite-fault's strike-parallel direction 

  - $AveStrike$: average of strike-parallel directions over the segments of FF model; useful for curved fault rupture
  - $LocStrike$: representing the local strike-parallel direction near a station ($definition$)
  - _Note_: Both strike-parallel directions can be utilized to rotate the two horizontal components of ground-motion time series to strike-normal and strike-parallel components. In the two NGA Projects, $LocStrike$ has been used for that purpose.

- Direct-Point Parameter of rupture directivity (Spudich Chiou, 2013; Chiou and Spudich, 2013)
  - $\hat{c}'$: approximate isochrone velocity, normalized to a shear-wave velocity of 3.2 km/s
  - $E$: length of the hypocenter-to-direct-point (H2D) line source
  - $aveR$: radiation pattern averaged over the H2D line source
  - $DPP$: direct-point parameter of rupture directivity
